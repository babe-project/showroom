# Showroom

This repository contains an (admittedly pointless) example experiment which demonstrates several features of _magpie (minimal architecture for the generation of portable interactive experiments).

More information about _magpie can be found [here](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html).

## Online demo
You can have a look at the experiment [here](https://magpie-showroom.netlify.com/).
